The program "final_linking.py" contains different functions to :
1. Load previous embedding format
2. Load embeddings generated by AutoExtend
3. Remove zero embeddings
4. Perform synset linking
5. Evaluate synset linking

Executing this file will evaluate all these steps from top to bottom. It takes the following arguments:
1. Hindi embedding path
2. English embedding path
3. True linkage file (for evaluation)
4. POS tag

The file create_vec_kp.py create synset embeddings by averaging word embeddings. It takes as an input:
1. Synset to word mapping
2. Word to word embedding mapping
and generates a synset to synset embedding mapping file


Other notebooks are intermediate explorations which led to the functions in the final_linking.py file.

The script "runme.sh" will run the "final_linking.py" code with different embeddings and generate the results for the same.
